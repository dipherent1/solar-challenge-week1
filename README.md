# Solar Challenge Week 1

This repository contains the data science project for the Solar Challenge Week 1 assignment, focusing on solar energy analysis and optimization.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze solar energy data to develop insights and predictive models related to:

- Solar energy production forecasting
- Efficiency optimization of solar panels
- Impact of weather conditions on energy generation
- Seasonal patterns in solar energy production
- Cost-benefit analysis of solar installations

The analysis will utilize real-world solar production data along with weather information to create actionable insights for optimizing solar energy systems.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (3.10 recommended)
- Git
- Pip (latest version)

### Dependencies

This project uses the following key libraries:

- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Development**: Jupyter, Black, Flake8, Pytest

### Setting up the development environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-challenge-week1.git
   cd solar-challenge-week1
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   python -c "import numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn; print('Setup successful!')"
   ```

5. Configure Jupyter to use the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=solar-challenge --display-name="Python (Solar Challenge)"
   ```

## Usage

### Data

1. Place your solar energy datasets in the `data/` directory (not tracked by git)
   - Solar production time series data
   - Weather data
   - Panel configuration information

2. Data Processing
   - Use scripts in the `scripts/` directory for data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Example: `python scripts/preprocess_solar_data.py --input data/raw/solar_data.csv --output data/processed/`

3. Analysis and Modeling
   - Use notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for exploratory data analysis and visualization
   - Recommended workflow:
     1. `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration
     2. `02_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Create features from raw data
     3. `03_model_training.ipynb` - Train predictive models
     4. `04_model_evaluation.ipynb` - Evaluate model performance

4. Implementation
   - Core functionality is implemented in the `src/` directory
   - Import these modules in your notebooks or scripts:

     ```python
     from src.data import preprocessing
     from src.models import forecasting
     from src.visualization import plots
     ```

5. Testing
   - Run tests to ensure code quality:

     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```

   - Run specific test files:

     ```bash
     pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py
     ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the Solar Challenge project!

### Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Follow the coding standards:
   - Use Black for code formatting
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Write unit tests for new functionality

3. Make your changes and run tests:

   ```bash
   # Format code
   black .

   # Run linting
   flake8 .

   # Run tests
   pytest
   ```

4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers

### Development Workflow

- **Feature branches**: Create from `main` for new features
- **Bugfix branches**: Create from `main` for bug fixes
- **Release branches**: Create from `main` for release preparation
