# Solar Challenge Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for solar energy data exploration, analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Purpose

- Exploratory data analysis of solar energy production data
- Visualization of solar panel performance metrics
- Correlation analysis between weather conditions and energy output
- Time series analysis of solar energy generation patterns
- Predictive modeling for solar energy forecasting
- Documentation of analysis methodology and findings
- Presentation of insights to stakeholders

## Recommended Workflow

Follow this suggested workflow for a structured analysis approach:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial exploration of solar production data
   - `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - `03_weather_correlation.ipynb`: Analyzing weather impact on solar production
   - `04_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Creating features for modeling (time-based, weather-based)

3. **Modeling**
   - `05_baseline_models.ipynb`: Simple forecasting models (moving average, linear regression)
   - `06_advanced_models.ipynb`: Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM)
   - `07_model_evaluation.ipynb`: Comparing model performance and feature importance

4. **Insights and Visualization**
   - `08_production_insights.ipynb`: Key findings about solar energy production patterns
   - `09_optimization_strategies.ipynb`: Recommendations for optimizing solar panel efficiency

## Best Practices

- **Notebook Structure**:
  - Begin with a clear title and description
  - Include import statements in a dedicated cell at the top
  - Document assumptions and methodology
  - Include markdown cells explaining your analysis steps
  - End with conclusions and next steps

- **Code Quality**:
  - Use consistent variable naming
  - Include comments for complex operations
  - Extract reusable functions to the `src` directory
  - Keep visualization code separate from data processing

- **Reproducibility**:
  - Set random seeds for reproducible results
  - Document data sources and versions
  - Include version information for key libraries
